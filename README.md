# Abstract Iterator
Implementation of behavioral design pattern Iterator on PHP.
The pattern implemented in that way you can use it in your project just inherit it (kept Open-Closed from SOLID principles).
Also kept psr principles in code style and psr-4, so you can use composer to autoload it in your project.
